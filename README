SYNOPSIS
    KDE Wallet based implementation of Passwd::Keyring.

        use Passwd::Keyring::KDEWallet;

        my $keyring = Passwd::Keyring::KDEWallet->new(
             app=>"blahblah scraper",
             group=>"Johnny web scrapers",
        );

        my $username = "John";  # or get from .ini, or from .argv...

        my $password = $keyring->get_password($username, "blahblah.com");
        unless( $password ) {
            $password = <somehow interactively prompt for password>;

            # securely save password for future use
            $keyring->set_password($username, "blahblah.com");
        }

        login_somewhere_using($username, $password);
        if( password_was_wrong ) {
            $keyring->clear_password($username, "blahblah.com");
        }

    Note: see Passwd::Keyring::Auto::KeyringAPI for detailed comments on
